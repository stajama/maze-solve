# maze-solve-j
In a recent &lt;computerphile>, Mike Pound created an algorithm that solves mazes from image files, but his implementation was too complex for me. In the meantime, I'd like to try to create my own implementation to solve the problem. Will eventually attempt to implement Dijkstra and A-Star pathing techniques.
